## JavaScript Native Object

avaScript has several built-in or native objects. These objects are accessible anywhere in your program and will work the same way in any browser running in any operating system.

### Here is the list of JavaScript Native Objects:

1. JavaScript Number Object: The Number object represents numerical date, either integers or floating-point numbers.

2. JavaScript Boolean Object: The Boolean object represents two values, either "true" or "false".
   
3. JavaScript String Object: The String object lets you work with a series of characters; it wraps Javascript's string primitive data type with a number of helper methods.
   
4. JavaScript Array Object: The Array object lets you store multiple values in a single variable. It stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type.
   
5. JavaScript Date Object: The Date object is a datatype built into the JavaScript language. Date objects are created with the new Date( ) as shown below.

6. JavaScript Math Object: The math object provides you properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions.
   
7. JavaScript RegExp Object: The JavaScript RegExp class represents regular expressions, and both String and RegExp define methods that use regular expressions to perform powerful pattern-matching and search-and-replace functions on a text.
